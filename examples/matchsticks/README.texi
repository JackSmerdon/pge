@subsection Overview of matchsticks

Here is a very basic game called matchsticks.  The idea is to control
the gold ball and hit the light wood boxes encapsulating the blue balls.
If a blue ball hits the floor it is deleted.  You need to make all blue
balls disappear before you run out of time.

You can interfere with the gold ball by pressing the mouse left and
right buttons.  If the ball hits the triangles it gains a small amount
of velocity.  All other collisions are very slightly inelastic.

@subsection Interesting aspects of the matchsticks implementation

It uses timers to coordinate the time left and it uses event callbacks
to handle mouse presses.  The blue balls initially are free moving and
they quickly change internally to the stationary state.  Once they are
hit or a matchstick is deleted all objects in the stationary state
become free moving again.
