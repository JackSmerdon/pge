@subsection Overview of breakout

Here is a very basic version of upside down breakout.  You can interfere
with the gold ball by pressing the mouse left and right buttons.  If the
ball hits the triangles it gains a small amount of velocity.  All other
collisions are very slightly inelastic.

@subsection Interesting aspects of the breakout implementation

It uses timers to coordinate the time left and it uses event callbacks
to handle mouse presses.  Each blue box is deleted with a callback upon
collision.
